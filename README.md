# Clirdle

This is just a cli version of Worldle. I am building it to see best strategies etc with exhaustive testing.

# About

Started with [github.com/dwyl/english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)- which is 466K English words. Pulled the 5 letter words out with bash and now we have a huge wordlist to pull from, test against.

I believe the original wordlist was for spellchecking, and so it has some proper nouns and such - maybe not in the original, but here we are.

Right now its OK. I have to clean up presentation, and keep track of the alphabet for the user. The other thing is to integrate the wordle style UTF-8 shareable snippets of your score. e.g. Green boxes.
